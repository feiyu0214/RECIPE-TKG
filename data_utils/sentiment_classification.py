    You are analyzing relation labels from a political event knowledge graph.
    Each relation describes an action or request in a geopolitical context. 
    Unless the relation is truly ambiguous or purely procedural, avoid using "neutral".

    Please classify the sentiment of the following relation into one of:
    - positive (e.g., promoting peace, aid, cooperation)
    - negative (e.g., violence, repression, aggression)
    - neutral (e.g., procedural or ambiguous actions)

    Only reply with one word from the list above.
